# About

This blog is intended to capture my thoughts on street photography and highlight interesting content that I have discovered about this style on the web.

Built using [thegrid.io][0], I had hoped that it would be possible to use it as my own photography portfolio. However, in this early iteration I realise that I require more control over how my photos are displayed.
